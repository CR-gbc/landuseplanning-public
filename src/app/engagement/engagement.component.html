        <h2>Pre-Planning</h2>
        <p>Land management issues are discussed between the B.C. government and Indigenous government(s), as well as
          with
          stakeholders and communities. Resource managers try to resolve issues using existing land use plans or other
          stewardship
          initiatives. If there are no existing land use plans for the area, or the existing land use plans are no
          longer an
          effective tool to resolve land use issues, the B.C. government and Indigenous government(s) will determine an
          appropriate path forward. If land use planning is the desired approach, the parties will begin scoping out a
          proposed
          land use planning project, including timelines and costs, then seek a mandate from the Minister of Forests,
          Lands,
          Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development to secure resources and proceed.</p>
