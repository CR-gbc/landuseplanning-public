          <h2>Steps for Completing a Land Use Plan</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Pre-Planning.</strong> Collaborate with First Nations and agree in principle to undertake a land use plan to resolve
            land-based issues. Develop a business case and seek mandates to proceed.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan Initiation.</strong> Get organized to conduct a planning process. Formalize agreement to proceed with planning, finalize planning scope,
            develop a project budget and stakeholder engagement strategy.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan Development.</strong> Apply information and planning tools to produce scenario analyses that address planning issues. Select a preferred
            planning scenario and prepare a draft plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan Evaluation and Approval.</strong> Evaluate draft land use plan, provide dispute resolution and revise plan as required. Submit land use plan for review
            and approval by planning partners.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan Implementation and Monitoring.</strong> Develop an implementation plan that includes associated agreements with planning partners and a secured implementation
            budget. Monitor planning outcomes and assess the planâ€™s effectiveness.</li>
