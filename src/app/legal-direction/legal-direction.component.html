        <p>The purpose of land use planning is to set strategic direction to guide sustainable resource stewardship and management
        of provincial public land and waters. Land use plans are considered when reviewing proposed land use activities.
        Resource management objectives – statements of desired outcomes for resource values or resource use – are an important
        part of land use plans and are in some cases legally established to support the implementation of plans or agreements.</p>
        <p>Direction generated by planning processes is implemented by the B.C. government using a combination of provincial
        legislation, regulations, ministerial orders, and orders-in-council. In general, these tools require Cabinet or a
        Minister of a specific Ministry (or a Minister’s delegate) to establish land use designations and resource management
        objectives.</p>
        <p>Examples of applicable legislation include, but are not limited to, the:</p>
        <ul class="mb-0">
          <li>Land Act</li>
          <li>Forest and Range Practices Act</li>
